These are REdCap database schema definitions, written using simpleredcapbuilder to handlle substitutions, shared / common items and repeating items. 

A reminder that the compact database definition (a `csv` or `xlsx`) is expanded via a `json` and `jinja` form to give a `csv` data dictionary for upload to redcap.
